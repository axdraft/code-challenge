# AXDRAFT Technical Interview Code Challenge

Hello and welcome to one of our code challenges!

The rules are simple:

1. This repository holds a branch called `pricing`
2. We would like you to review the PR without using GitHub's UI
3. At the end - please submit your review (in a format of your choice that would be useful and easy to read) to team@axdraft.com

You should review for errors, style and system design. Try to give good arguments and convincing examples.

## Good luck!
